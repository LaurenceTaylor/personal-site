        I graduated from Queen Mary University of London in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science in Geography.
        I recently completed Makers, a highly selective coding school in London, and sit on the Youth Advisory Panel of Global Action Plan.
        In my spare time I enjoy playing five-a-side football, reading, and playing guitar.
